# 基準（TBD)

Reference:

[OpenBadge](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt) ヨーロッパ、日本、アメリカで使用されている。

[Blockcerts](https://github.com/1EdTech/cert-schema) は、MIT Media Lab

[https://github.com/1EdTech/cert-schema](https://github.com/1EdTech/cert-schema)

OpenBadge の拡張版。

Marketingを勉強する には良さそう。しかし、ここが違う所。

[https://microcredentials.digitalpromise.org/explore](https://microcredentials.digitalpromise.org/explore)　のマーケットがいい感じ。

OpenBadge　のExtension/そのまま使う可能性を探る

![didcore](https://github.com/MicroEdgeCerts/documentation/assets/2448586/0bf463aa-08d8-4154-9539-3f4c01752db7)


InterOperabilityにすると、MECではここを補うことが必要。

あと　DID Methodは発行者独自と書いてあるから。ここも補うことが必要。

Task1: 
そこにIssuerのメタデータを置くか・IssuerのCRU（Dはなし）をだれが許可するかがDAOの役目？

Open Badge = The badge cannot be verified (the badge's authenticity cannot be proven) without the Issuer's platform.

MEC = By using the blockchain as a registry, the authenticity can be verified without a platform.

1. Structure of the Registry:
   - Classes can be aligned across multiple issuers. (Tag feature?)
   - Ability to have multiple courses.

```
- Verifiable Data Registry
- Issuer
- Verifier = Application generated according to standards.
- Reviewer = Users are companies seeking to hire.
- Holder = Learner
```

### Use Case

**Issuer Side:**
1. The issuer registers issuer information and course content.
2. The issuer issues MEC to the Learner.

**Learner 1:**
1. Obtain MEC.
2. Refer to MEC content.
3. (Out of Scope) Optionally share MEC Bundle.

**Learner 2:**
1. Go to the Registry and refer to courses of interest.
2. View the Issuer's content.
3. (Out of Scope) It would be nice to see how many MECs have been issued and evaluations from the Learner's side.

### Data Structure

**Issuer (Issuer)**
```
id: 0000-xxx00...
name: Chiba Institute of Technology
Corporate Number: xxx-xxx-xxx
Country: Japan
Address: Chiba Prefecture...
logo:
```

**Class**
```
id:
name:
description:
logo:
expiration (optional):
tags: [web3, it]
Verification Method: Public Key
```

**Tags / Categories**
```
name: web3
```

**MEC**
```
Issue Date:
Name:
logo:
expiration:
```


The format uses [JWT](https://identity.foundation/jwt-vc-presentation-profile/#base64url-encoding-of-a-jwt-encoded-vc-included-in-a-vp) data VC to check for tampering.

### MEC Data Model

![MECDataModel](https://github.com/airinterface/microedgecerts.github.io/assets/2448586/e8a4fd34-6431-4682-9030-bb6fda5506ad)


1. badge: BadgeClass includes signatureLines images in BlockCerts, but I don't think they are necessary here (verification is done by Verification).
2. Credential: In BlockCerts, the recipient is included in the Badge, but to conform to OpenBadge, it is moved back to the RootLevel. However, I like the term Recipient, so I want to keep it.
3. Recipient: This needs further discussion. It is included in BlockCerts but not in OpenBadge.
4. IssuedCredentialMeta: In the future, marketplace and similar course viewing functions may be possible. This could be a point of discussion whether to use IPFS or DB.

### Examples

- OpenBadge example: [https://github.com/1EdTech/openbadges-specification/tree/develop/ob_v3p0/examples](https://github.com/1EdTech/openbadges-specification/tree/develop/ob_v3p0/examples)
- BlockCerts example: [https://github.com/1EdTech/cert-schema/blob/master/docs/schemas.md](https://github.com/1EdTech/cert-schema/blob/master/docs/schemas.md)

### Question 1:

- Can the Web3 Introduction course be included in the Registry?
